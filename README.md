## Calculator!
### About
#### *A super Calculator made by @NehalRam. This monstrosity of a calculator was built for lightning fast smooth calculations.This a followup(update) to the first version(V1.0, https://replit.com/talk/share/Calculator/140230). This update sees the release of exit commands. they are essentially commands that you can type in at any input to rerun the Calculator!*
### How to use-
#### Please note: you can enter x at any input to rerun the code, Any str other than x in any number inputs are detected by the prioram and it gives an str error asking you to give the input correctly again 
#### *When this message(Enter the First number)shows up, enter a number in your calculation).* 
Then enter your operation("+"/"-"/"/"/"**")*
#### *Then enter your second number.(Note:if your operation is divison and second number input is 0 it shows an error.) Then the anwer of your calculation comes in. then enter the new number(if any) and then enter the operaton again. This process continues until an exit command is entered.*
### Bugs & Glitches
#### *Not known yet. Let me know if any*
### Updates
#### The next update might have a new command called break command or i wanted to combine the older version with the newer one to make 2 modes-
#### *The express mode(for one operation throughout the calculation*
#### *The slow mode(for different oprations at different numbers*)
### Other projects-
#### Monster hunters
##### *a text based rpg adventure game*
